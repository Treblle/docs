## Requirements

- requests

## Installation

You can install Treblle for django via [PYPi](https://pypi.org/). Simply run the following command:

```shell
$ pip install treblle
```

Don't forget to load the required python modules in your settings.py like so:

```py
INSTALLED_APPS = [
...
'treblle',
]
```

```py
MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = [
...
'treblle.middleware.TreblleMiddleware',
]
```

## Getting started

Next, create a FREE account on [Treblle](https://treblle.com) to get an API key and Project ID. After you have those simply initialize Treblle in your **settinsg.py** file like so for django:

```py
TREBLLE_INFO = {
'api_key': os.environ.get('TREBLLE_API_KEY'),
'project_id': os.environ.get('TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID')
}
```

That's it. Your API requests and responses are now being sent to your Treblle project. Just by adding these lines of code you get features like: auto-documentation, real-time request/response monitoring, error tracking and so much more.

## Need to hide additional fields?

If you want to expand the list of fields you want to hide, you can pass property names you want to hide by using the `TREBLLE_HIDDEN_KEYS` setting like in the example below.

```py
TREBLLE_HIDDEN_KEYS = ["id", "email"]
```

```py
TREBLLE_INFO = {
'api_key': os.environ.get('TREBLLE_API_KEY'),
'project_id': os.environ.get('TREBLLE_PROJECT_ID'),
'hidden_keys' : TREBLLE_HIDDEN_KEYS
}
```

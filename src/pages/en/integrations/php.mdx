import TreblleIntegrations from '../../../components/TreblleIntegrations.astro'
import CopyBody from '../../../components/CopyBody.tsx'

## Requirements

- PHP 7.4+

## Dependencies

- [`guzzlehttp/guzzle`](https://packagist.org/packages/guzzlehttp/guzzle)

## Installation

You can install Treblle for PHP via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). Simply run the following command:

<CopyBody client:load>
  ```bash $ composer require treblle/treblle-php ```
</CopyBody>

## Getting started

Next, create a FREE account on [treblle.com](https://treblle.com) to get an API key and Project ID. After you have those simply
initialize Treblle in your API code like so:

<CopyBody client:load>
```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use GuzzleHttp\Client;
use Treblle\Factory\TreblleFactory;

require_once **DIR**.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

error_reporting(E_ALL);
ob_start();

$treblle = TreblleFactory::create('_YOUR_API_KEY_', '_YOUR_PROJECT_ID_');

````
</CopyBody>

That's it. Your API requests and responses are now being sent to your Treblle project. Just by adding that line of code
you get features like: auto-documentation, real-time request/response monitoring, error tracking and so much more.

## Configuration options

### Debug mode

The third parameter sent to `TreblleFactory::create` factory method is a boolean flag indicating whether we want to use
Treblle in debug mode. Enabling debug mode is helpful when you want to understand what's happening under-the-hood and
allow Treblle errors to bubble up.

<CopyBody client:load>
```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use GuzzleHttp\Client;
use Treblle\Factory\TreblleFactory;

// DON'T FORGET TO AUTOLOAD COMPOSER DEPENDENCIES
require_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

error_reporting(E_ALL);
ob_start();

$treblle = TreblleFactory::create(
    '_YOUR_API_KEY_',
    '_YOUR_PROJECT_ID_',
    false, // Debug mode
);
````

</CopyBody>

### Masking sensitive information

Treblle **masks sensitive information** from the request parameters **before it even leaves your server**. The following
parameters are automatically
masked: `password, pwd, secret, password_confirmation, cc, card_number, ccv, ssn, credit_score`. You can extend this
list by providing your own custom keywords by doing the following:

<CopyBody client:load>
```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use GuzzleHttp\Client;
use Treblle\Factory\TreblleFactory;

// DON'T FORGET TO AUTOLOAD COMPOSER DEPENDENCIES
require_once **DIR**.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

error_reporting(E_ALL);
ob_start();

/\*

- Pass an array of words that you would like to be masked
- as a fourth parameter when initializing Treblle
  \*/
  $treblle = TreblleFactory::create(
  '_YOUR_API_KEY_',
  '_YOUR_PROJECT_ID_',
  false, // Debug mode
  ['keyword', 'maskme', 'sensitive']
  );

````
</CopyBody>

### Overriding HTTP client and Treblle endpoint URL

The fifth parameter passed to `TreblleFactory::create` factory method is an array of config options allowing you to
override some components of Treblle.

The following values are supported:

- `client` - an instance of Guzzle client configured to behave as you want (e.g. controling the timeout or other
  aspects)
- `url` - Treblle API endpoint URL you want to use

<CopyBody client:load>
```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use GuzzleHttp\Client;use Treblle\Factory\TreblleFactory;

// DON'T FORGET TO AUTOLOAD COMPOSER DEPENDENCIES
require_once __DIR__.'/../vendor/autoload.php';

error_reporting(E_ALL);
ob_start();

/*
* Pass an array of words that you would like to be masked
* as a fourth parameter when initializing Treblle
*/
$treblle = TreblleFactory::create(
    '_YOUR_API_KEY_',
    '_YOUR_PROJECT_ID_',
    false, // Debug mode
    ['keyword', 'maskme', 'sensitive'],
    ['client' => new Client(), 'url' => 'https://custom.treblle.com']
);
````

</CopyBody>

Treblle was designed for both non-technical and technical roles that monitor, analyze and manage APIs, and technical roles that build, ship and maintain them on daily basis.

HTTP APIs or as it is commonly known - APIs(Application Programming Interfaces) - are interfaces that allow communication between different software systems using the HTTP protocol.

They are used to build web applicatiions and mobile apps as well as integrated with other systems, and automate processes. Like when you pay for a product via Stripe, you are using the Stripe's payment APIs.

So when you build or consume APIs, you spend a lot of time on every stage of the API lifecycle on doing things like:

* Administration
* Writing documentations
* Providing support
* Debugging
* Monitoring or measuring

> Treblle allows both API providers and consumers to focus on their business implementation and leave the API management and observability to Treblle.

If your role is one of the following listed below, Treblle is a great tool to have in your arsenal as it consolidates everything you will need for API **management**, **monitoring**, and **observability** in a single accessible [Dashboard](/en/dashboard).

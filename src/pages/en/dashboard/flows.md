A series of API calls is called a Flow in Treblle.

Flows lets you group API [requests](/en/dashboard/requests) that together are used to achieve a particular task like registering a user.

Let's take registering a user for example.

Perhaps to register a user, your flow might include requests to do the following:

- Verify username
- Send email verification
- Verify email

With flows, Treblle makes it easy to communicate these series of API calls to someone that wants to integrate with your API as they can see which requests they have to make for each step, what data to be sent and what to expect back.
